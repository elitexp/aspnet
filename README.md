# Aspnet Alike Service Provider Inside Laravel

Asp.Net Unobtrusive validation & Ajax Support for Laravel

## Insight
Many might have used validation provided by the Laravel framework. No doubt, it's a good one. Others might have used Asp.Net MVC framework and its attributes to provide client-side and server side-validation. It's very easy. What I've tried to do is to use the JavaScript Library (JQuery Unobtrusive Validation) into a Laravel Project. The model defines the rules from each properties of the model, the validator just takes care of server side as well as the client side validation. What you have to do, just include the validation JavaScript scripts into the form. That's all.


##Features

a. Asp.Net Unobtrusive Client Side Validation support<br/>
b. Server Side & Client side validation with plug and play feature (autoload)<br/>
c. Ajax links & ajax form submit (will be added in due course)<br/>
d. Artisan make:aspnetmodel & make:aspnetvalidator commands for generating the validator and the model.


## Documentation

Documentation for the validator will be released shortly.
Currently, the example can provide the insight.(Inside the examples folder)
